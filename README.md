# ShoppingCart

OOP, or Object Oriented Programming, is one of the major approaches to the software development process. In OOP, developers use objects and classes to structure their code.

In this shopping cart project, I want to learn how to define classes and use them. I'll create class instances and implement methods for data manipulation.

This project will cover concepts like the ternary operator, the spread operator, the THIS keyword, and more.
